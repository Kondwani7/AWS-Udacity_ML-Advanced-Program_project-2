### Project 2: Developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch Project
- In this project, pytorch was used to classify digits from the range 0 to 9.
- To handle classification, deep neural networks
- Adding the validation set helped the baseline model perform really well  (95.5% validation)
- After some hyperparamter tuning (adding dropout, adjusting learning rate and steps), 
  the model accuracy rose from the baseline 95.5%  to 95.9%.
- This was a small gain, indicating that potentially due to the size of the dataset, very little improvements could be made.
